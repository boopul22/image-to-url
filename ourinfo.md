# 👋 Hi, I'm Boopul

I’m an **AI-powered creator, no-code explorer, and disciplined builder** who believes that consistency beats talent and action beats intention.

My journey hasn’t been smooth or privileged. I grew up with limited resources, struggled academically in my early years, and paid my own college fees through persistence and self-learning. Those experiences shaped how I think, work, and build today — with **clarity, resilience, and focus on long-term growth**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **AI, no-code tools, design, automation, and personal development**. I build things not just to ship them, but to understand systems deeply and improve myself in the process.

## 🧠 What I Do

- Build **small apps, tools, and websites** using AI, no-code, and lightweight tech
- Experiment with **AI workflows** to automate ideas and simplify complex tasks
- Design and contribute to **digital assets and creative projects**
- Create content around **discipline, fitness, self-improvement, and stoic thinking**
- Continuously improve my **English communication and clarity of thought**

I prefer practical execution over theory, clean systems over noise, and steady progress over shortcuts.

## 🏋️‍♂️ Discipline & Growth

Fitness and discipline play a big role in my life. I train regularly, follow structured routines, and treat physical health as a foundation for mental clarity and consistency.  
The same mindset applies to my work — **show up daily, improve incrementally, and trust the process**.
